                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                  Hello, welcome to my page. I am Nicole Lanteigne, a graduating third year graphic design student. I've been interested in art my whole life, therfore making a career out of it is a dream come true. I was a traditional artist only until 2019, I would be mostly use pencils, makers, and pens. I did paint as well, I still do all these things but now I also draw in Procreate and Adobe.</p>
                    <p>
                  I may have started with drawing but I now have learned so much more with art. I've been able to achieve new goals woth new tools. Learning new softwares was difficult in the beginning but now I couldn't reach my goals. I have found advertising design work and marketing design to be one of my new favourite ways of design. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I created the brand named "farmers" which is a company that makes hard ciders and hard seltzers. The concept of these drinks is to be able to taste around Canada, it started in Ontario. All of the flavours are from different farms in Ontario only. I created two can designs and mockups that are the seltzers, which are blueberry and nectarine flavour. The ciders were made into two bottles with the flavours being classic apple and pear. After creating the brand and products I created some social media mockup designs, this includes instagram post and pag, facbook ads and facebook posts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In this project I had to pick one of the two teams that were competiting for the greycup. I chose Winnipeg for this project, I had to create a winning team shirt for the winnipeg fans. I made sure to included fan favourites and the important roles in football. These roles included the coach, the counterback, linebacker, wide receiver and the kicker. I used all their colours, I made sure to look up the cmyk of their colours to make sure it was exact. I also used the same font as their "W" logo to keep everything tied in with each other.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I created this piece back in 2023 I created this piece for fun, my cousin is a cowgirl I partly made this piece for her. I used reference photos for both girls and the horse. I wasn't too sure what the real plan for this piece was, all I knew is I wanted a cowgirl silhoutette. Once everything was in place I added the gradiant background with the colours of a sunset. I debated on adding facial details but I didn't because I thought it would be too busy looking. The sunset background is filling the whole page with the black over top, which is how I was able to add in the small hair details. I used the eraser tool to add in strands of hair, the words and my signature.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>While putting my portfolio together I decided I wanted more advertising designs involved, I decided to create an ad for Windsor beer festival. I wanted something bright but also not losing the design, I drew a cartoon beer then I enlarged it to fit the frame I was working in. I used the colours from the illustration for the text colours. When I put the font in the corner I wanted to make sure it wouldn't get lost therefore I made it black and included two beers cheering, this was to help bring the eye down to the bottom for information. I also included this to show that it is going to be a fun event. </p>
